00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,250
Hey there, welcome back to
this module on ASP.NET Core,

1
00:00:05,251 --> 00:00:07,710
my name is Jeff Fritz
>> And I'm Jon Galloway.

2
00:00:07,711 --> 00:00:10,610
>> And, we're gonna talk
a little in this module about,

3
00:00:10,611 --> 00:00:13,480
authentication and
authorization security, right?

4
00:00:13,481 --> 00:00:15,910
>> Right, right, so there's a
lot in there let's get started.

5
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:20,458
I'm creating a new
ASP NET Core application.

6
00:00:20,459 --> 00:00:23,034
And one of the things on
the dialog here is, it has this

7
00:00:23,035 --> 00:00:26,700
thing on the right, where it
says change authentication.

8
00:00:26,701 --> 00:00:28,770
So that said, no authentication.

9
00:00:28,771 --> 00:00:31,670
That means, the application
is completely anonymous.

10
00:00:31,671 --> 00:00:33,440
>> Right, anybody can access it.

11
00:00:33,441 --> 00:00:34,730
>> Right, exactly.

12
00:00:34,731 --> 00:00:37,780
So what we're gonna be
showing in this section,

13
00:00:37,781 --> 00:00:40,740
we're gonna be looking at
individual user accounts.

14
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:42,270
There are some others available.

15
00:00:42,271 --> 00:00:44,550
You can do Windows
authentication, for

16
00:00:44,551 --> 00:00:45,770
an intranet application.

17
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,810
>> So that would use
internal Windows challenge

18
00:00:50,811 --> 00:00:54,390
capabilities with IIS, so it can
check with Active Directory, and

19
00:00:54,391 --> 00:00:56,310
make sure that folks
are logged in.

20
00:00:56,311 --> 00:00:56,990
>> Exactly.

21
00:00:56,991 --> 00:01:00,390
>> Okay.
>> All that magical IIS

22
00:01:00,391 --> 00:01:02,100
intranet stuff.

23
00:01:02,101 --> 00:01:05,380
There's also school accounts and
this all set out.

24
00:01:05,381 --> 00:01:10,350
This works with active
directory O365, and

25
00:01:10,351 --> 00:01:15,520
it has support for cloud, single
and multiple organizations.

26
00:01:15,521 --> 00:01:18,880
So kinda the simplest one, and
I think kinda the most standard

27
00:01:18,881 --> 00:01:21,850
that a lot of people use is
individual user accounts.

28
00:01:21,851 --> 00:01:22,830
>> Okay.
>> This is kind of a good

29
00:01:22,831 --> 00:01:24,660
place to get started.

30
00:01:24,661 --> 00:01:28,620
And you have some options here,
storing your accounts in app

31
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:30,660
actually uses local databases-
>> Okay.

32
00:01:30,661 --> 00:01:32,520
>> For
storing there the information.

33
00:01:32,521 --> 00:01:35,250
And where you can also
connect this to stool in

34
00:01:35,251 --> 00:01:36,320
the cloud, right?

35
00:01:36,321 --> 00:01:38,160
>> Sure.
>> So that's one nice thing is,

36
00:01:38,161 --> 00:01:41,179
you can develop for a while, and
then you can migrate over later.

37
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:44,420
>> Very good.
>> So we're going to do this,

38
00:01:44,421 --> 00:01:46,460
store user account in app.

39
00:01:46,461 --> 00:01:48,510
So I'll click OK,
and get started.

40
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:53,528
So the first thing we're going
to be looking at in here once we

41
00:01:53,529 --> 00:01:54,412
start this up,

42
00:01:54,413 --> 00:01:58,130
is that our authentication
is set up using middleware.

43
00:01:58,131 --> 00:02:01,520
So like just about everything
in ASP NET core now,

44
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:03,240
it's all configured
in middleware.

45
00:02:03,241 --> 00:02:07,460
So if I go to my startup, we'll
see if we scroll down a bit,

46
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:12,020
we have in here use identity.

47
00:02:12,021 --> 00:02:16,710
So this is actually
the service is configured to

48
00:02:16,711 --> 00:02:21,350
use the identity service, with
default token providers, etc.

49
00:02:21,351 --> 00:02:24,030
We'll be configuring more
of those in a second.

50
00:02:24,031 --> 00:02:29,200
And then down in here,
it says app.UseAuthentication.

51
00:02:29,201 --> 00:02:30,690
So that's kinda
what turns it on.

52
00:02:30,691 --> 00:02:33,890
>> And it's there inside of our

53
00:02:33,891 --> 00:02:37,420
configure method between
static files and UseMvc.

54
00:02:37,421 --> 00:02:40,930
So that we're not authenticating
access to the static files.

55
00:02:40,931 --> 00:02:41,500
>> Exactly.

56
00:02:41,501 --> 00:02:44,050
>> But we are gonna check for
authentication requirements for

57
00:02:44,051 --> 00:02:45,360
npc pages.

58
00:02:45,361 --> 00:02:48,410
>> Exactly, that's a very key
point, that this middleware kind

59
00:02:48,411 --> 00:02:49,940
of falls there,
it goes top to bottom.

60
00:02:49,941 --> 00:02:52,670
So, it'll get called
in that order.

61
00:02:52,671 --> 00:02:55,920
So, I'll want my static files,
CSS, etc, for

62
00:02:55,921 --> 00:02:57,250
my log in pages, right?

63
00:02:57,251 --> 00:02:57,840
>> Sure.

64
00:02:57,841 --> 00:02:59,080
>> That's important.

65
00:02:59,081 --> 00:03:00,450
So just right out of the box,

66
00:03:00,451 --> 00:03:02,430
I'm going to run
this application.

67
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,370
And then, we'll go through and

68
00:03:05,371 --> 00:03:07,590
we'll start configuring
some things in here.

69
00:03:07,591 --> 00:03:10,770
So, when I run this,
first of all,

70
00:03:10,771 --> 00:03:13,900
some of the things I'm going to
be doing with my application,

71
00:03:13,901 --> 00:03:16,770
I'm gonna be later setting
up OAuth for login,

72
00:03:16,771 --> 00:03:20,870
and that's gonna require SSL,
the way OAuth is

73
00:03:20,871 --> 00:03:23,650
setup to call backs to my
application require SSL.

74
00:03:23,651 --> 00:03:27,470
Fortunately, Visual Studio and
IS kind of do this for

75
00:03:27,471 --> 00:03:28,920
me automatically.

76
00:03:28,921 --> 00:03:34,950
So what this is doing is it's
saying, I can create an IS SSL

77
00:03:34,951 --> 00:03:38,480
certificate for you, and install
it locally on your machine.

78
00:03:38,481 --> 00:03:41,350
For development this is
a real easy way to go.

79
00:03:41,351 --> 00:03:43,290
So I'm gonna say, okay, and

80
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:46,258
I'm gonna memorize that show
one thumbprint, just kidding.

81
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:46,865
[LAUGH].

82
00:03:46,866 --> 00:03:48,580
I'm gonna install
the certificate.

83
00:03:48,581 --> 00:03:51,280
So this certificate is installed
locally on my machine.

84
00:03:51,281 --> 00:03:53,500
>> Okay.
>> What that allows me to do,

85
00:03:53,501 --> 00:03:57,910
is run my application locally,
you'll see in the address bar

86
00:03:57,911 --> 00:04:02,630
that it actually does say,
get this out of here, https.

87
00:04:02,631 --> 00:04:05,160
So that allows me to kind of
right from the beginning of my

88
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:10,150
development, start
testing with SSL locally.

89
00:04:10,151 --> 00:04:10,960
>> Okay.

90
00:04:10,961 --> 00:04:12,130
>> So the first thing
that I'm gonna do,

91
00:04:12,131 --> 00:04:13,590
is register a new user.

92
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:17,420
And I'm doing this with
individual user accounts.

93
00:04:17,421 --> 00:04:19,651
The very simplest
way to do this,

94
00:04:19,652 --> 00:04:22,212
is just create an email and
password.

95
00:04:22,213 --> 00:04:27,380
So, just create something.

96
00:04:29,876 --> 00:04:33,511
And there are some default
password requirements,

97
00:04:33,512 --> 00:04:35,580
need a capital letter, etc.

98
00:04:35,581 --> 00:04:36,850
And those are configurable.

99
00:04:40,939 --> 00:04:42,650
And they need to match.

100
00:04:42,651 --> 00:04:43,530
Let me try that again.

101
00:04:52,595 --> 00:04:53,410
There we go.

102
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,330
So it is nice that it at
least checks that for me.

103
00:04:57,331 --> 00:04:58,770
>> No.
>> No, it blew up.

104
00:04:58,771 --> 00:05:00,150
This is actually expected.

105
00:05:00,151 --> 00:05:03,410
The first time through that I
ran this, and the reason is,

106
00:05:03,411 --> 00:05:06,810
it needs to store my
identity data somewhere.

107
00:05:06,811 --> 00:05:07,530
>> Right.
>> And

108
00:05:07,531 --> 00:05:09,230
it's using Entity Framework for
that.

109
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,700
So this is actually
the first time through,

110
00:05:12,701 --> 00:05:13,930
that I access this.

111
00:05:13,931 --> 00:05:16,620
It's saying I need to create
those tables for you.

112
00:05:16,621 --> 00:05:18,254
>> So
it's gonna create those tables,

113
00:05:18,255 --> 00:05:20,430
in what kind of a database for
me?

114
00:05:20,431 --> 00:05:24,490
>> So
this is in my local SQL express.

115
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:25,350
>> Got you, the local DB.

116
00:05:25,351 --> 00:05:26,960
>> Yeah, local DB center, yeah.

117
00:05:26,961 --> 00:05:27,480
>> Okay.

118
00:05:27,481 --> 00:05:30,020
>> Exactly, so
now I hit apply migrations and

119
00:05:30,021 --> 00:05:32,070
this is creating that
database for me.

120
00:05:32,071 --> 00:05:35,550
>> So, this error screen
is entity framework saying,

121
00:05:35,551 --> 00:05:38,460
we don't have all the database
definitions created

122
00:05:38,461 --> 00:05:40,190
inside that database.

123
00:05:40,191 --> 00:05:42,460
Hey press this button to apply and-

124
00:05:42,461 --> 00:05:42,780
>> Exactly.

125
00:05:42,781 --> 00:05:43,690
>> Do those updates.

126
00:05:43,691 --> 00:05:46,840
>> So,
this is the migration that runs,

127
00:05:46,841 --> 00:05:50,120
it creates those, it actually
is all ready finished and

128
00:05:50,121 --> 00:05:52,710
it says,
try refreshing the page.

129
00:05:52,711 --> 00:05:55,230
So I'm gonna refresh
the page fortunately for

130
00:05:55,231 --> 00:05:58,480
me, it reset the form
when I refresh the page,

131
00:05:58,481 --> 00:06:01,880
it refreshes so I don't need
to type that password again.

132
00:06:01,881 --> 00:06:04,350
So great, there I've gone
through and logged in.

133
00:06:04,351 --> 00:06:06,450
>> And it says,
hello test at test.com.

134
00:06:06,451 --> 00:06:07,176
>> Exactly.
>> Cool, okay.

135
00:06:07,177 --> 00:06:08,880
>> So
let's configure that a bit.

136
00:06:08,881 --> 00:06:14,380
So, I'm going to go in, and I
am going to click on my account.

137
00:06:14,381 --> 00:06:19,140
I will see in here, I can change
my email, or phone number.

138
00:06:19,141 --> 00:06:21,890
I can do things like send
a verification email.

139
00:06:21,891 --> 00:06:24,730
I could, update my password.

140
00:06:24,731 --> 00:06:25,690
>> Sure.

141
00:06:25,691 --> 00:06:26,890
>> What I want to
show here though,

142
00:06:26,891 --> 00:06:29,265
is configuring two-factor
authentication.

143
00:06:29,266 --> 00:06:32,220
And two-factor authentication
is really important.

144
00:06:32,221 --> 00:06:36,330
This is a great feature to
enable for your applications.

145
00:06:36,331 --> 00:06:39,620
The reason is,
if someone gets my password

146
00:06:39,621 --> 00:06:41,660
they can take over my
account very easily.

147
00:06:41,661 --> 00:06:44,640
However, if I setup
two-factor authentication

148
00:06:44,641 --> 00:06:48,970
on my phone, using a two
factor authentication application-

149
00:06:48,971 --> 00:06:49,900
>> Yes.

150
00:06:49,901 --> 00:06:52,960
>> Then someone would need both
my password, and my phone.

151
00:06:52,961 --> 00:06:53,740
>> Sure.

152
00:06:53,741 --> 00:06:55,070
>> And so,

153
00:06:55,071 --> 00:06:58,760
it's just adding a second factor
of authentication for me.

154
00:06:58,761 --> 00:07:03,840
So if I click on here and
I say, add authenticator app,

155
00:07:03,841 --> 00:07:06,760
this is going to take me to
a page, and it's gonna tell me,

156
00:07:06,761 --> 00:07:13,435
hey, you could go in, you could
type in this code, and this

157
00:07:13,436 --> 00:07:17,625
code is actually a seed for a
time based TOTP password thing,

158
00:07:17,626 --> 00:07:21,835
where it regenerates a password,
every I believe, 30 seconds.

159
00:07:21,836 --> 00:07:22,595
>> Okay.

160
00:07:22,596 --> 00:07:26,123
>> Now, we'll look at that
in a second, but your users,

161
00:07:26,124 --> 00:07:29,117
this isn't the best
experience to make them,

162
00:07:29,118 --> 00:07:31,217
type this key into their phone.

163
00:07:31,218 --> 00:07:32,163
>> No.

164
00:07:32,164 --> 00:07:34,719
>> Most two factor of,
is set up on phone, and

165
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,400
I don't want them
to have to do that.

166
00:07:37,401 --> 00:07:38,060
>> Sure.

167
00:07:38,061 --> 00:07:41,540
>> So, a nice way to kinda
get this information

168
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:44,590
over on to my phone,
is using a QR code.

169
00:07:44,591 --> 00:07:45,162
>> Okay.
>> So,

170
00:07:45,163 --> 00:07:48,028
there's actually some pretty
good documentation on here, and

171
00:07:48,029 --> 00:07:50,957
we're just gonna follow through
what they're telling us to do.

172
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,866
And it's actually,
surprisingly, easy.

173
00:07:52,867 --> 00:07:53,594
>> Good.

174
00:07:53,595 --> 00:07:56,285
>> So yeah, so
what we're doing for this,

175
00:07:56,286 --> 00:08:00,245
is we're actually using a Java
Script library that is going

176
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:02,159
to generate a QR code for me.

177
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,927
>> Okay.

178
00:08:03,928 --> 00:08:06,978
>> So you can add this
to your application,

179
00:08:06,979 --> 00:08:09,325
any number of different ways.

180
00:08:09,326 --> 00:08:11,244
I'm going to do
this using bower,

181
00:08:11,245 --> 00:08:13,240
just cuz bower is
currently set up.

182
00:08:13,241 --> 00:08:15,515
But, you could use
any kind of bundling,

183
00:08:15,516 --> 00:08:18,960
you could use You know you could
just download the file into your

184
00:08:18,961 --> 00:08:20,524
directory if you wanted to.

185
00:08:20,525 --> 00:08:27,324
So this is qr-js, and
I'm just going to pick star,

186
00:08:27,325 --> 00:08:32,530
there's just one version of it.

187
00:08:32,531 --> 00:08:34,010
And we'll save that.

188
00:08:34,011 --> 00:08:40,058
And so then that's going
to dump this file into,

189
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:45,900
procure, that's now
the secure code JS.

190
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:49,616
So you just need to put it
somewhere in your dub dub dub

191
00:08:49,617 --> 00:08:52,100
root and know where you put it.

192
00:08:52,101 --> 00:08:54,835
>> So you made an update
to Bower JSON.

193
00:08:54,836 --> 00:08:57,020
>> Mm-hm.
>> You included the qrcode-js

194
00:08:57,021 --> 00:08:57,680
line, and

195
00:08:57,681 --> 00:09:01,780
in the background, Visual Studio
kicked off a Bower install and

196
00:09:01,781 --> 00:09:04,985
it wrote the contents of
that package into that

197
00:09:04,986 --> 00:09:09,790
qrcode-js folder inside of the
lib sub folder of dub dub root.

198
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:10,360
>> Exactly.

199
00:09:10,361 --> 00:09:10,860
>> Okay.
>> And

200
00:09:10,861 --> 00:09:14,220
it's important to note,
[LAUGH] Bower

201
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:17,590
was kind of a preferred way of
installing packages for a while.

202
00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:19,230
It's kind of going away.

203
00:09:19,231 --> 00:09:22,320
Bower is still maintained but
it's not kind of

204
00:09:22,321 --> 00:09:24,330
the recommended way really-
>> Okay.

205
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:25,570
>> To get libraries
going forward.

206
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,940
So, you'll see this probably
change in the future.

207
00:09:28,941 --> 00:09:32,896
But the important point here
really is get this library and

208
00:09:32,897 --> 00:09:35,003
put it in your dub dub dub root.

209
00:09:35,004 --> 00:09:35,542
[LAUGH].

210
00:09:35,543 --> 00:09:39,085
>> Okay.
>> So now what we're going to do

211
00:09:39,086 --> 00:09:45,617
is we're going to look in our
pages account manage enable

212
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:50,799
authenticator view so
I go to pages account.

213
00:09:53,131 --> 00:09:57,750
Manage, Enable Authenticator.

214
00:09:57,751 --> 00:09:58,670
So, and again,

215
00:09:58,671 --> 00:10:01,890
that was that spelled out for
me right here in the docs.

216
00:10:01,891 --> 00:10:04,690
Next, I'm going to scroll down
to the bottom of the script

217
00:10:04,691 --> 00:10:07,060
section and
I'm going to paste this.

218
00:10:07,061 --> 00:10:10,230
And the important thing
here is to make sure

219
00:10:10,231 --> 00:10:14,920
that my path to this
script is correct.

220
00:10:14,921 --> 00:10:19,600
And I wanna put this below my
ValidationScriptsPartial, okay?

221
00:10:19,601 --> 00:10:23,330
So all I'm doing here is putting
in the script that is going to

222
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:26,050
enable generating
client side qrCode.

223
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,910
So now,
I'm actually gonna go here and

224
00:10:29,911 --> 00:10:33,680
I'll take advantage of
Visual Studio's auto complete.

225
00:10:33,681 --> 00:10:37,344
And auto complete
completes that for me and

226
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:39,490
I know it's gonna work.

227
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:43,820
Right so now that that's there,
I'll run this again.

228
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:48,810
And we'll see when
we go to that page.

229
00:10:48,811 --> 00:10:53,199
Well actually, when we go
to enable two factor auth.

230
00:11:01,229 --> 00:11:04,220
So if I say,
configure authenticator app.

231
00:11:04,221 --> 00:11:06,280
Now, this is my QR code.

232
00:11:06,281 --> 00:11:07,020
>> Fancy.

233
00:11:07,021 --> 00:11:10,720
>> Yeah, so that QR code
just makes an easy way for

234
00:11:10,721 --> 00:11:12,650
me to get this data
onto my phone.

235
00:11:12,651 --> 00:11:13,180
>> Okay.
>> So

236
00:11:13,181 --> 00:11:15,210
the next step that I
would do is actually,

237
00:11:15,211 --> 00:11:18,750
on my phone I would
take a snapshot.

238
00:11:18,751 --> 00:11:20,550
I would go into my
authenticator app and

239
00:11:20,551 --> 00:11:23,800
I would scan this QR code and
it'll say great,

240
00:11:23,801 --> 00:11:26,245
added and it'll do all
the magic registration.

241
00:11:26,246 --> 00:11:28,320
>> It'll start
generating codes for me.

242
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:29,240
>> Yep.

243
00:11:29,241 --> 00:11:33,300
Now, because we wanna kind of go
through and show how this works,

244
00:11:33,301 --> 00:11:37,240
I'm actually going to use
a test online authenticator app

245
00:11:37,241 --> 00:11:38,370
that can do this for me.

246
00:11:38,371 --> 00:11:38,900
>> Okay.

247
00:11:38,901 --> 00:11:40,930
>> So if I go in here and

248
00:11:40,931 --> 00:11:44,590
I copy this code, this is
something you might want to

249
00:11:44,591 --> 00:11:47,550
do just in development in order
to kind of make sure that your

250
00:11:47,551 --> 00:11:48,700
two factor auth is working.

251
00:11:48,701 --> 00:11:51,650
>> And then you don't
end up polluting your

252
00:11:51,651 --> 00:11:54,760
personal authenticator on your
phone with all these test codes.

253
00:11:54,761 --> 00:11:56,120
>> Exactly, exactly.

254
00:11:56,121 --> 00:11:58,300
So I can call this
whatever I want.

255
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:05,370
MVA 2FA, and
then I paste in this secret key.

256
00:12:05,371 --> 00:12:10,350
This secret key is kind of
the seed that's going to create

257
00:12:10,351 --> 00:12:13,850
these two factor auth numbers
that I'm gonna actually type in.

258
00:12:13,851 --> 00:12:15,930
>> So there's my six
digit number I would use

259
00:12:15,931 --> 00:12:17,090
to authenticate.

260
00:12:17,091 --> 00:12:18,080
>> Exactly.

261
00:12:18,081 --> 00:12:22,100
So now what I need
to do is go into,

262
00:12:22,101 --> 00:12:25,695
now you watch, see that just
rolled over every 30 seconds.

263
00:12:25,696 --> 00:12:26,430
>> Yeah.

264
00:12:26,431 --> 00:12:28,350
>> So
now I need to go into this and

265
00:12:28,351 --> 00:12:31,390
I need to give it my off code.

266
00:12:31,391 --> 00:12:34,372
Once I do this it verifies
it and it says great,

267
00:12:34,373 --> 00:12:36,300
two factor auth is set up.

268
00:12:36,301 --> 00:12:36,860
>> Cool.

269
00:12:36,861 --> 00:12:37,750
Now what are these?

270
00:12:37,751 --> 00:12:42,430
>> Well,
what happens if I lose my phone?

271
00:12:42,431 --> 00:12:44,080
>> Or get a new phone,
or whatever?

272
00:12:44,081 --> 00:12:48,940
>> Right, you drop it in
a stream or something, my gosh.

273
00:12:48,941 --> 00:12:50,660
>> Exactly.
So, what they do for

274
00:12:50,661 --> 00:12:53,660
this is they give me
these recovery keys.

275
00:12:53,661 --> 00:12:57,460
So these recovery keys
are something I can use, and

276
00:12:57,461 --> 00:13:00,360
I recommend putting
these in a secure place.

277
00:13:00,361 --> 00:13:04,260
>> Those are two columns
of five keys, right?

278
00:13:04,261 --> 00:13:05,300
>> Total of ten keys.

279
00:13:05,301 --> 00:13:06,450
>> Okay.
>> Yup so

280
00:13:06,451 --> 00:13:10,290
these are keys that you
want to keep these, but

281
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,370
you want to keep them
somewhere secure.

282
00:13:12,371 --> 00:13:13,580
>> Sure.
>> Somewhere secret and

283
00:13:13,581 --> 00:13:14,980
somewhere secure.

284
00:13:14,981 --> 00:13:17,940
So now let's log out and
log in and

285
00:13:17,941 --> 00:13:20,580
this time we'll see
using two factor auth.

286
00:13:20,581 --> 00:13:21,520
So I'm gonna hit log in.

287
00:13:21,521 --> 00:13:26,570
I'm gonna type in test, and

288
00:13:26,571 --> 00:13:28,100
we'll see if I can
type my password.

289
00:13:30,498 --> 00:13:32,896
>> You gotta get past that first
factor authentication before we

290
00:13:32,897 --> 00:13:34,183
get to the second.

291
00:13:34,184 --> 00:13:35,253
No!

292
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:38,600
>> There it is.

293
00:13:38,601 --> 00:13:39,160
>> All right.

294
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:42,800
>> It requires an uppercase,

295
00:13:42,801 --> 00:13:45,960
a number and-
>> Special character?

296
00:13:45,961 --> 00:13:46,711
>> Special character.

297
00:13:46,712 --> 00:13:47,610
Yeah.

298
00:13:47,611 --> 00:13:51,260
So now, it says what's
your authenticator code?

299
00:13:51,261 --> 00:13:54,572
Now I would go on to my phone
and I would look up my app that

300
00:13:54,573 --> 00:13:57,380
I just registered and
it'll give me a number.

301
00:13:57,381 --> 00:14:00,847
So in this case, I'm going
to my pretend phone and

302
00:14:00,848 --> 00:14:04,562
I look here and I see this is
my two factor auth number,

303
00:14:04,563 --> 00:14:06,780
my authenticator code.

304
00:14:06,781 --> 00:14:07,846
So I'll hit that.

305
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:10,808
Now, what I would normally want
to do is say remember on this

306
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:12,150
machine.

307
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:13,860
I'd likely want to do
that because I don't

308
00:14:13,861 --> 00:14:17,930
want to necessarily have to
type that in every single time.

309
00:14:17,931 --> 00:14:18,430
>> And you're in.
>> I'm in.

310
00:14:18,431 --> 00:14:20,620
Now let's look one more time and

311
00:14:20,621 --> 00:14:22,210
we'll see what happens.

312
00:14:22,211 --> 00:14:24,995
Let's see if I can maybe
type my password this time.

313
00:14:24,996 --> 00:14:26,070
>> [LAUGH]
>> I should've

314
00:14:26,071 --> 00:14:35,663
saved my password? Okay.

315
00:14:35,664 --> 00:14:38,482
So now, no, my phone exploded

316
00:14:38,483 --> 00:14:42,650
into a thousand pieces,
what am I gonna do?

317
00:14:42,651 --> 00:14:44,437
So now I'm gonna
actually go in here and

318
00:14:44,438 --> 00:14:45,960
say log in using
a recovery code.

319
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,320
So I can grab one of these and

320
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:52,760
what I recommend doing
is actually delete it.

321
00:14:52,761 --> 00:14:54,220
So I did CTRL + X.

322
00:14:54,221 --> 00:14:55,330
>> These are one time use?

323
00:14:55,331 --> 00:14:56,360
>> They're one time use.

324
00:14:56,361 --> 00:14:57,280
>> Okay.
>> Once I use that thing

325
00:14:57,281 --> 00:14:58,690
then it's gone.

326
00:14:58,691 --> 00:15:01,540
So then I'll go in here and
go Log in.

327
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:03,260
And now,
my two factor auth worked.

328
00:15:03,261 --> 00:15:04,950
>> Okay.
>> And what you can do,

329
00:15:04,951 --> 00:15:06,590
if you want to at that point,

330
00:15:06,591 --> 00:15:09,750
is you can actually go
reset recovery codes.

331
00:15:09,751 --> 00:15:11,310
>> And get a new
collection of ten codes.

332
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:14,510
>> So now it regenerated
all those old codes that I

333
00:15:14,511 --> 00:15:16,590
generated, those are all
worthless now, so

334
00:15:16,591 --> 00:15:19,990
I'm just gonna paste those over.

335
00:15:19,991 --> 00:15:23,780
And you can put this in, you
know, say a OneDrive, OneNote,

336
00:15:23,781 --> 00:15:26,210
somewhere secure though,
because someone gets these,

337
00:15:26,211 --> 00:15:27,920
they can bypass your
two factor auth.

338
00:15:27,921 --> 00:15:29,210
>> Absolutely.

339
00:15:29,211 --> 00:15:31,900
>> So let's kind of
review what we did here.

340
00:15:31,901 --> 00:15:32,970
We went in and

341
00:15:32,971 --> 00:15:37,120
we first saw the different
options that are available.

342
00:15:37,121 --> 00:15:38,870
We looked in our startup, and

343
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:41,530
we saw kind of how things
are configured, and

344
00:15:41,531 --> 00:15:45,130
that use authentication kind
of is already wired up for me.

345
00:15:45,131 --> 00:15:47,560
And this stuff about
token providers and

346
00:15:47,561 --> 00:15:48,530
stuff that's already there.

347
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:53,270
Then we went in,
created a basic account, and

348
00:15:53,271 --> 00:15:56,430
then we went in and
did our authentication.

349
00:15:56,431 --> 00:15:59,180
Now, one other thing,
one other kind of minor thing,

350
00:15:59,181 --> 00:16:02,329
but, there's the thing
in there that says,

351
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:05,900
hey here's how you can create.

352
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:10,740
The first time when you go in
and you set up two factor auth,

353
00:16:10,741 --> 00:16:15,130
there's a little note there that
says, here's how to enable it.

354
00:16:15,131 --> 00:16:17,310
>> I think it was under
Configure Authenticator app?

355
00:16:17,311 --> 00:16:19,700
>> Configure Authenticator app,
that's it.

356
00:16:19,701 --> 00:16:21,420
So here,
you'll delete this line.

357
00:16:21,421 --> 00:16:23,430
>> Sure, we don't wanna
ship that instruction.

358
00:16:23,431 --> 00:16:24,840
>> Yeah, exactly.

359
00:16:24,841 --> 00:16:25,830
But that's basically it.

360
00:16:25,831 --> 00:16:28,560
So this is pretty sophisticated,

361
00:16:28,561 --> 00:16:34,461
this will allow you to keep your
customer's application secure.

362
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,610
Yeah, pretty great.

363
00:16:37,611 --> 00:16:38,290
>> Cool.

364
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:40,970
All right, I hope you come back
and join us in a little bit.

365
00:16:40,971 --> 00:16:44,131
We're gonna take a look at
more authentication options in

366
00:16:44,132 --> 00:16:45,039
the next video.
