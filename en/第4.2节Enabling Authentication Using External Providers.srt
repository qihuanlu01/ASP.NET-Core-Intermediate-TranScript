00:00:01,094 --> 00:00:05,440
Hey there, welcome back to this
module about ASP.NET Core.

1
00:00:05,441 --> 00:00:06,760
My name is Jeff Fritz.

2
00:00:06,761 --> 00:00:08,080
>> I'm Jon Galloway.

3
00:00:08,081 --> 00:00:11,330
>> And, Jon, we built an
application in that last video

4
00:00:11,331 --> 00:00:14,840
where we showed how to log
in to our application, but

5
00:00:14,841 --> 00:00:16,800
I've already got
a Microsoft account and

6
00:00:16,801 --> 00:00:19,240
a Twitter account and
a Facebook account.

7
00:00:19,241 --> 00:00:21,770
Can I use one of those to
login to my application?

8
00:00:21,771 --> 00:00:24,920
>> Well, yeah,
that's exactly what will show.

9
00:00:24,921 --> 00:00:26,190
Password are terrible.

10
00:00:26,191 --> 00:00:27,080
>> They are.

11
00:00:27,081 --> 00:00:29,210
>> If you remember
on the last thing,

12
00:00:29,211 --> 00:00:30,615
I can't miss type my password.

13
00:00:30,616 --> 00:00:31,880
>> Mm-hm.
>> I wanna

14
00:00:31,881 --> 00:00:34,040
manage as few
passwords as possible.

15
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:36,840
And as an application
developer I wanna manage this

16
00:00:36,841 --> 00:00:38,410
few passwords as
well as possible.

17
00:00:38,411 --> 00:00:41,660
I don't want people breaking
into my application and

18
00:00:41,661 --> 00:00:46,090
stealing user passwords, people
sometimes reuse passwords on

19
00:00:46,091 --> 00:00:48,750
other sites,
I don't wanna deal with that.

20
00:00:48,751 --> 00:00:52,430
So what's a lot better is if
I can let people login to my

21
00:00:52,431 --> 00:00:55,850
application using Google,
Microsoft, Facebook,

22
00:00:55,851 --> 00:00:56,739
Twitter, etc.

23
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:59,560
And let them deal with it.

24
00:00:59,561 --> 00:01:01,470
>> Sure.
>> So we'll show how to do that.

25
00:01:01,471 --> 00:01:03,390
I'm on my application.

26
00:01:03,391 --> 00:01:05,110
>> Okay.
>> And I'm gonna click on

27
00:01:05,111 --> 00:01:06,550
Log In.

28
00:01:06,551 --> 00:01:09,780
And when I do that, you'll see
over on the left side it has

29
00:01:09,781 --> 00:01:13,670
this kind of standard user
account with email and password.

30
00:01:13,671 --> 00:01:17,920
Over on the right side though
it says, there's no external

31
00:01:17,921 --> 00:01:20,090
authentication services
configured.

32
00:01:20,091 --> 00:01:22,760
See this article for details.

33
00:01:22,761 --> 00:01:25,980
>> So more boiler plate text
there that instruct us how to

34
00:01:25,981 --> 00:01:28,410
configure that application
if we wanna add the feature.

35
00:01:28,411 --> 00:01:29,970
>> Exactly,
this is prompting me.

36
00:01:29,971 --> 00:01:32,850
This is saying all you've
got set up right now is user

37
00:01:32,851 --> 00:01:33,570
name and password.

38
00:01:33,571 --> 00:01:36,820
There are some steps to
configure it in your application

39
00:01:36,821 --> 00:01:39,950
so that it can use external
authentication services, but

40
00:01:39,951 --> 00:01:41,370
here's how to do it.

41
00:01:41,371 --> 00:01:46,070
Now you need to go through
these different steps for

42
00:01:46,071 --> 00:01:47,630
each provider.

43
00:01:47,631 --> 00:01:51,070
So, for Facebook, for Twitter,
for Google, for Microsoft, for

44
00:01:51,071 --> 00:01:53,500
other open idea or
out to providers.

45
00:01:53,501 --> 00:01:57,360
So you need to go through and
configure that.

46
00:01:57,361 --> 00:01:59,550
It's not a whole
lot of steps but.

47
00:01:59,551 --> 00:02:01,050
So we're gonna go
through in this one.

48
00:02:01,051 --> 00:02:02,520
I'm gonna use some
Microsoft account.

49
00:02:02,521 --> 00:02:04,120
But you could use whatever, and

50
00:02:04,121 --> 00:02:06,640
the steps are all kinda
written here in the dots.

51
00:02:06,641 --> 00:02:10,750
And it was off that link I
clicked in my application there.

52
00:02:10,751 --> 00:02:15,854
So what I'm gonna do here is I'm
going to start with creating

53
00:02:15,855 --> 00:02:20,570
an application using
Microsoft application, right?

54
00:02:20,571 --> 00:02:26,810
So I'm going to go in and
I've gone to apps.dev.microsoft.com

55
00:02:26,811 --> 00:02:28,030
>> Okay.

56
00:02:28,031 --> 00:02:29,720
And I'm gonna click
on Add an app.

57
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:35,160
So now I need to give
it My MVA Sample.

58
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,274
And then I could go through
here, there's this guided setup

59
00:02:40,275 --> 00:02:43,625
and if I do that, it's actually
going to give me like a little

60
00:02:43,626 --> 00:02:46,147
wizard to point me at
some sample code stuff.

61
00:02:46,148 --> 00:02:50,228
But I'm an expert here, I've
done this a gazillion times I'm

62
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:54,001
just gonna click on Create, and
so it's going to go out and

63
00:02:54,002 --> 00:02:57,260
provision a new application for
me.

64
00:02:57,261 --> 00:03:00,190
So now let's make sure that we
are kind of following along

65
00:03:00,191 --> 00:03:04,190
here and I'm going to go in and
find where it's got

66
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,760
my Microsoft instructions.

67
00:03:08,761 --> 00:03:11,240
So, this is kind of showing
how to configure it

68
00:03:11,241 --> 00:03:13,660
on the Microsoft side, right?

69
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:16,170
So, you will log in,
you will create and

70
00:03:16,171 --> 00:03:19,350
there you will see there is my
application I've just added.

71
00:03:19,351 --> 00:03:20,270
>> Okay.

72
00:03:20,271 --> 00:03:23,650
>> All right, so now let's
kinda work through this.

73
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,870
So, in here, that's my name.

74
00:03:28,871 --> 00:03:29,450
I will,

75
00:03:29,451 --> 00:03:33,750
as I work down the list, I will
need to generate a new password.

76
00:03:33,751 --> 00:03:37,200
So when I click this
generate password, this is,

77
00:03:37,201 --> 00:03:38,710
it's a secret.

78
00:03:38,711 --> 00:03:42,270
I'm going to use this in my
application, and I need to store

79
00:03:42,271 --> 00:03:45,910
this, so when this pops up it's
only gonna show it to me once.

80
00:03:45,911 --> 00:03:47,780
So I just copied that.

81
00:03:47,781 --> 00:03:52,430
And I'm gonna go over
into notepad here and

82
00:03:52,431 --> 00:03:54,160
I'm going to paste
that down here.

83
00:03:54,161 --> 00:03:57,020
So this is from a previous one,
I'm just going to,

84
00:03:57,021 --> 00:03:58,940
that's my password there.

85
00:03:58,941 --> 00:04:02,450
And then here is
my Application Id.

86
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:07,040
So those are the two things I'm
going to need to configure in my

87
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:09,140
app in order to do that.

88
00:04:09,141 --> 00:04:12,140
So I'm actually going to be

89
00:04:12,141 --> 00:04:15,620
pasting these as secrets
into my application.

90
00:04:15,621 --> 00:04:19,310
So just while I'm here I'm gonna
go ahead and paste this in here.

91
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:22,730
And this here.

92
00:04:22,731 --> 00:04:25,620
This is going to be
information I'm going to be

93
00:04:25,621 --> 00:04:27,660
using in my application
in just a minute.

94
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,070
>> So, these two data points.

95
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:35,240
This is effectively
the user ID and password

96
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:40,190
that your application will
use to access the Microsoft

97
00:04:40,191 --> 00:04:44,330
account website and do a check
on user ID's and passwords.

98
00:04:44,331 --> 00:04:45,290
>> That's exactly.

99
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:47,040
>> Okay.
>> So my application needs a way

100
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:51,410
to call into a Microsoft
account to the Microsoft, or

101
00:04:51,411 --> 00:04:53,925
whatever it is Twitter,
Google, etc, etc.

102
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:56,690
I'm this registered application
I need you to look up

103
00:04:56,691 --> 00:04:57,700
the user for me.

104
00:04:57,701 --> 00:04:58,220
>> Okay.
>> So

105
00:04:58,221 --> 00:05:00,300
that's how we're doing that.

106
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:04,340
So then here I'm gonna click in,
I'm gonna say Add Platform and

107
00:05:04,341 --> 00:05:07,730
at this point I'm going
to need a URL for this.

108
00:05:07,731 --> 00:05:10,030
And this part is
actually is important.

109
00:05:10,031 --> 00:05:11,600
You've got to get,
I mean it's all important.

110
00:05:11,601 --> 00:05:14,970
But this part is,
if you get this wrong,

111
00:05:14,971 --> 00:05:18,690
it's just not gonna work and
you'll be frustrated, right.

112
00:05:18,691 --> 00:05:21,616
Unlike some other errors
that you can get developing,

113
00:05:21,617 --> 00:05:24,378
if you get this part wrong,
it just doesn't work.

114
00:05:24,379 --> 00:05:25,030
>> Man.
>> You don't get

115
00:05:25,031 --> 00:05:25,960
an error message.

116
00:05:25,961 --> 00:05:30,060
You just get a couldn't find
your application kind of thing.

117
00:05:30,061 --> 00:05:34,340
So what I need to do is I'm
going to look at my app and

118
00:05:34,341 --> 00:05:36,450
I have this URL.

119
00:05:36,451 --> 00:05:41,070
It's local host,
blah, blah, blah.

120
00:05:41,071 --> 00:05:45,800
So I'm going to copy
that part in here.

121
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,880
And then I need to get

122
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:54,680
the second part which is
sign in dash Microsoft.

123
00:05:54,681 --> 00:05:59,270
So within my application
there's actually,

124
00:05:59,271 --> 00:06:05,160
there's kind of route generated
to enable this call back.

125
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:09,010
So I'm gonna go like that.

126
00:06:09,011 --> 00:06:14,420
Right, so what this tells the
Microsoft account registration

127
00:06:14,421 --> 00:06:18,590
thing is once you kinda look
this person up, here's how you

128
00:06:18,591 --> 00:06:21,280
call back into my application
and say they're good to go.

129
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:22,130
>> Okay.
>> Right.

130
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:24,110
>> And
it'll notify your application.

131
00:06:24,111 --> 00:06:27,240
That it's John Galloway signed
in with his Microsoft account.

132
00:06:27,241 --> 00:06:27,760
>> Exactly.
>> Okay.

133
00:06:27,761 --> 00:06:31,720
>> Will pass that information
over who that person is.

134
00:06:31,721 --> 00:06:34,280
So an important thing here
is once you type that in,

135
00:06:34,281 --> 00:06:35,940
you gotta hit the save button.

136
00:06:35,941 --> 00:06:37,480
>> Okay.
>> So I got that wrong before I

137
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:39,120
went through and I was like,
what's going on?

138
00:06:39,121 --> 00:06:40,090
Why isn't that working?

139
00:06:40,091 --> 00:06:42,870
So that is an important step.

140
00:06:42,871 --> 00:06:47,660
[LAUGH] So now that we have
that information configured

141
00:06:47,661 --> 00:06:52,060
over on the Microsoft side,
on the Microsoft account side.

142
00:06:52,061 --> 00:06:55,960
Now, I need to take that
information, here's the password

143
00:06:55,961 --> 00:07:00,150
and all that and I need to
configure this in my app.

144
00:07:00,151 --> 00:07:04,673
So I actually wanna do this
using the secret management

145
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:09,490
thing that's built into,
built into ASP.NET Core.

146
00:07:09,491 --> 00:07:10,250
>> Okay.

147
00:07:10,251 --> 00:07:13,020
>> So remember,
I've got these things here,

148
00:07:13,021 --> 00:07:17,110
this is my application ID and
password.

149
00:07:17,111 --> 00:07:18,750
>> Right.
>> And

150
00:07:18,751 --> 00:07:20,250
I might be tempted
to just go and

151
00:07:20,251 --> 00:07:23,880
put this in my appconfig or
my appsettings json.

152
00:07:23,881 --> 00:07:24,950
>> App Settings Json.

153
00:07:24,951 --> 00:07:25,580
Don't do that.

154
00:07:25,581 --> 00:07:26,705
>> That's a bad idea, right?

155
00:07:26,706 --> 00:07:31,012
Because oops, I might check that
in the source control, etc. Absolutely.

156
00:07:31,013 --> 00:07:32,220
>> I don't wanna do that.

157
00:07:32,221 --> 00:07:35,350
So there's a thing built
into ASP.NET Core that has,

158
00:07:35,351 --> 00:07:37,710
it's called user secrets.

159
00:07:37,711 --> 00:07:42,380
And so I can just go in, oops,
I can grab this bit here.

160
00:07:44,805 --> 00:07:46,133
And paste that in.

161
00:07:46,134 --> 00:07:52,460
So this user secrets thing is
just a standard JSON file, and

162
00:07:52,461 --> 00:07:56,040
what this is doing this will not
get checked into source control.

163
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:58,710
And what I'm gonna wanna do
then is when I deploy this

164
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:01,540
application to production, say
I'm using Azure I would go in

165
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:03,825
and set an application
setting for that.

166
00:08:03,826 --> 00:08:05,700
>> Mm-hm.
>> I would set in a environment

167
00:08:05,701 --> 00:08:07,823
variable in another server, etc.

168
00:08:07,824 --> 00:08:11,900
I wanna store this on the server
as an environment variable and

169
00:08:11,901 --> 00:08:14,640
not in source code
with my application.

170
00:08:14,641 --> 00:08:15,180
>> Right.

171
00:08:15,181 --> 00:08:16,500
>> Makes sense?

172
00:08:16,501 --> 00:08:19,060
>> Keep production
configuration in production.

173
00:08:19,061 --> 00:08:19,940
>> Exactly.

174
00:08:19,941 --> 00:08:22,970
Okay, so now the one final
thing I need to do is,

175
00:08:22,971 --> 00:08:24,950
I've got these secrets stored.

176
00:08:24,951 --> 00:08:26,750
And I need to go in and

177
00:08:26,751 --> 00:08:31,560
I need to tell it, hey,
use Microsoft account and

178
00:08:31,561 --> 00:08:35,710
here's how to look at that
application ID and password.

179
00:08:35,711 --> 00:08:39,110
So I'm going to go
into my start up and

180
00:08:39,111 --> 00:08:44,880
right below the place where
it does the AddIdentity.

181
00:08:44,881 --> 00:08:48,180
So he's right, it kind of
configure the basic identity.

182
00:08:48,181 --> 00:08:51,260
I'm going to, on this line here,

183
00:08:51,261 --> 00:08:54,620
I need to stop my app in order
to make source code changes.

184
00:08:54,621 --> 00:08:57,310
So I'll go in here and
I'll paste that.

185
00:08:57,311 --> 00:09:01,610
So this says AddAuthentication
turn on the Microsoft account

186
00:09:01,611 --> 00:09:04,118
and for the Microsoft account
use this client ID and

187
00:09:04,119 --> 00:09:05,740
this client secret.

188
00:09:05,741 --> 00:09:07,250
So they use some
different names,

189
00:09:07,251 --> 00:09:10,610
client ID, client secret
you'll notice in here that

190
00:09:10,611 --> 00:09:13,400
the Microsoft account called it
something slightly different.

191
00:09:13,401 --> 00:09:14,850
>> Yeah they call
them a password.

192
00:09:14,851 --> 00:09:17,350
>> But there's basically
it's a user ID and

193
00:09:17,351 --> 00:09:19,370
some sought of password
secret sought of thing.

194
00:09:19,371 --> 00:09:20,640
>> Okay.

195
00:09:20,641 --> 00:09:23,330
>> So now I've got that setup,

196
00:09:23,331 --> 00:09:26,540
I'll verify in my steps
that I'm done here.

197
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:29,680
So here it calls that out by
difference in terminology.

198
00:09:29,681 --> 00:09:31,580
And now I can just
run my application.

199
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,090
Now in my case,

200
00:09:34,091 --> 00:09:38,130
I've already signed in with my
Microsoft account so hopefully

201
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,630
I'll just be able to kinda
click through and it will work.

202
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:47,060
All right so
it's starting on up.

203
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:51,760
So now I am going to log
out as test.test.com.

204
00:09:51,761 --> 00:09:54,970
And then hit Log in.

205
00:09:54,971 --> 00:09:57,950
And now you'll see this
button here and it's laid up.

206
00:09:57,951 --> 00:10:02,640
So if I go through that help,
and I configure also, say,

207
00:10:02,641 --> 00:10:03,690
Twitter and Google, etc.

208
00:10:03,691 --> 00:10:05,620
Those will show up here, too.

209
00:10:05,621 --> 00:10:06,550
>> Cool.

210
00:10:06,551 --> 00:10:08,680
>> So
now I'm gonna click on this.

211
00:10:08,681 --> 00:10:10,430
It calls over,
it redirects over.

212
00:10:10,431 --> 00:10:11,840
Now I've got a few different

213
00:10:11,841 --> 00:10:13,500
accounts with
Microsoft accounts.

214
00:10:13,501 --> 00:10:17,320
Fortunately Microsoft has
kinda support for that, right.

215
00:10:17,321 --> 00:10:21,755
So here it says okay we
need your permission.

216
00:10:21,756 --> 00:10:24,270
The thing I wanna verify
here is the user is

217
00:10:24,271 --> 00:10:26,260
that it's my Microsoft sample.

218
00:10:26,261 --> 00:10:29,240
Which I'll say application
that I think it is.

219
00:10:29,241 --> 00:10:31,220
Right and I'll say Yes.

220
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:36,280
And so now it's continuing that
it's go, it's logged in and

221
00:10:36,281 --> 00:10:39,630
now it's redirected back
in to my application.

222
00:10:39,631 --> 00:10:42,390
This would be the part where
if I had gotten that call back

223
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:44,880
URL wrong, this is where
it would have blown up.

224
00:10:44,881 --> 00:10:47,200
>> You would have ended up
in never, never length.

225
00:10:47,201 --> 00:10:49,930
>> It would have the Microsoft
authentication thing would have

226
00:10:49,931 --> 00:10:51,030
said couldn't find this.

227
00:10:51,031 --> 00:10:52,050
So it would show me in an error.

228
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:56,560
So now it says great,
we logged you in,

229
00:10:56,561 --> 00:10:59,810
we looked up your email address
for that Microsoft account so

230
00:10:59,811 --> 00:11:01,710
you can just click Register.

231
00:11:01,711 --> 00:11:03,350
And now, this is me.

232
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:08,150
So if I click through on
this it shows here's my

233
00:11:08,151 --> 00:11:11,690
external log in and that's my
registered external log in.

234
00:11:11,691 --> 00:11:14,260
>> You can have more than one
registered external login for

235
00:11:14,261 --> 00:11:15,670
a user which is kind of neat.

236
00:11:15,671 --> 00:11:16,580
>> And then I could go in and

237
00:11:16,581 --> 00:11:19,240
configure things like Two
factor authorization, etc.

238
00:11:19,241 --> 00:11:21,730
>> And
still increase the security

239
00:11:21,731 --> 00:11:23,530
of your account on
this application.

240
00:11:23,531 --> 00:11:28,670
>> Exactly, so what we saw here
was kinda the basic steps of

241
00:11:28,671 --> 00:11:32,690
going in and getting out of the
password management business.

242
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:34,830
I don't wanna manage
passwords in my application.

243
00:11:34,831 --> 00:11:38,250
I want another bigger service
where people are, run around

244
00:11:38,251 --> 00:11:41,920
with pagers and worry about
all that stuff all day long.

245
00:11:41,921 --> 00:11:45,430
So, what I've done is
set up an external

246
00:11:45,431 --> 00:11:48,680
authentication provider using
Microsoft and I've shown you

247
00:11:48,681 --> 00:11:51,638
where you could also hook
up Google, Twitter etc.

248
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:54,490
>> Cool, all right.

249
00:11:54,491 --> 00:11:56,180
Thanks so much for
sticking around and

250
00:11:56,181 --> 00:11:58,970
seeing about how to configure
authentication here.

251
00:11:58,971 --> 00:12:01,090
Hope you'd come back and
join us for our next video where

252
00:12:01,091 --> 00:12:02,800
we're gonna start talking
about authorization.
